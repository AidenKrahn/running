# running

1. OOP allows someone to do multiple things at once very easily, especially in a while loop. It also allows you to have things with behaviors which can be easily controlled and replicated.
2. 2. In procedural coding, I probably would use list elements, then change list elements in a while loop according to input, and then run definitions based on what the list element is. In
other words, it would be extremely backwards and annoying without the new tools at my disposal
3. OOP is very good for big programs that require a lot of input and make a lot of output. 
4. It requires a lot more effort and thinking about how everything works. Online tools DEFENITELY recommended.
